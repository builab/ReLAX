# RelAX: RELion Workflow for AXONEME

ReLAX is a workflow designed to perform subtomogram averaging of the axoneme. It originates from the Axoneme Align tool developed by Huy Bui in the lab of Dr. Takashi Ichikawa at the Paul Scherer Institute, Switzerland. ReLAX leverages modern image analysis software, RELION, to facilitate high-resolution structural analysis of the axoneme.

## Purpose
Our goal is to create an open-source software package that accelerates discoveries in cilia structure research. ReLAX is being actively developed in the Bui Lab by Molly Yu, Jerry Gao, and Huy Bui. Once feature-complete, we aim to support researchers in utilizing this tool for their own data analysis.

## Features
- **Subtomogram Averaging**: Automated workflow for axoneme structure determination.
- **Integration with RELION**: Utilizes modern cryo-EM tools for high-resolution analysis.
- **Open-Source Development**: Encourages community contributions and improvements.
