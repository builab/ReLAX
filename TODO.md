# TODO LIST

## 20250417
Complete imod2star with both ellipse & simple method

## 20250426 
sorted matching star files for processing in imod2star
write star_format & Angpix in name.
Fix rlnOpticsGroup in data_optics
Add rlnOpticsGroup in data_particles

# NEXT
data_general is in two lines
Make installation Conda for Relax with guideline updated in README.md
Writing star file not correct yet
Change script? Not sort then same order to streamline the code
Make the visualization, drawing vectors of angle
Test robustness by:
Delete 1,2 or 3 lines consecutively
Delete 2 non-consecutive
What if the cross-section doesnâ€™t cut every line

The angle difference between the ellipse and the normal fit for the paper.
Now, can we interpolate the angle for polarity 1 from polarity 0?
