Writing star file not correct yet
Make the visualization, drawing vectors of angle
Test robustness by:
Delete 1,2 or 3 lines consecutively
Delete 2 non-consecutive
What if the cross-section doesnâ€™t cut every line

The angle difference between the ellipse and the normal fit for the paper.
Now, can we interpolate the angle for polarity 1 from polarity 0?
